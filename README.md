# The hippocampal theta oscillation may be generated by chimera dynamics
Set of codes needed to reproduce the results presented in the article _The hippocampal theta oscillation may be generated by chimera dynamics_ (add arxiv link once submitted to the journal). 

## Structure
In this project there are different programs that are used for different objectives. (1) To generate the chimera on a ring and (2) the two-populations chimera. (3) To compute the mean phase velocity ratio for the chimera on a ring and (4) for the two-populations chimera. (5) To train a spiking neural network using the FORCE method to mimic the two-populations chimera previously generated.
(6) To plot and analize the chimera dynamics and the spiking recurrent network (basically the figures in the article).

Both chimera states were produced with the C++ code. Regarding the two population chimera, depending on the number of nodes (n = 3 or n = 25) the initial conditions change (see code to choose accordingly). The training of the spiking network was done with the python codes. To compute the mean phase velocity ratio we used python. Finally, you have the scripts to produce the different figures in the paper.
